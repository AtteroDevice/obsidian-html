## Install custom code
- Git clone this repository
- Open a terminal and `cd` into the cloned folder
- Run `python -m obsidianhtml -i /path/to/config.yml` to run obsidianhtml

This setup allows the code to be edited and quickly run again with the updated code.

> If you haven't installed obsidianhtml yet as described in section [Installation](../README.md#installation), you might miss packages. To resolve this, just install obsidianhtml, this will make sure all the dependencies are installed.
