# Going Down The Rabbithole   
The proces in which you start something and something inside of you keeps pulling you in further. It might be because of pure thrill, entertainment, or fascination, but can even lead to the idea that it is paramount; that it is a higher purpose just then uncovered.    
   
Going down the rabbithole is often linked with activities that expand or alter our sense of reality, like uncovering how things really work, and dabbling in conspiracy theories.
