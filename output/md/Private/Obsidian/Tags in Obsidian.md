# Tags in Obsidian   
This is a **tag**    
   
For a tag, the `#` is right next to the word. For a heading, there is a space between the `#` and the word.   
   
You can add tags to an entire page by adding [Frontmatter](../../Coding/Frontmatter.md) at the top of the page, like so:   
   
```
---
tags:
- MyTag
- another-tag
- tree/of-tags
---
```   
   
Note:    
> All items with a given tag are presented as being related… but it’s hard to see how. They’re just a jumbled, unordered list.
