# Obsidian know-how    
Table creation is pretty easy with [Advanced Tables](../../Private/Obsidian/Advanced Tables.md)   
   
## Know your shortcuts   
- Use Ctrl+E to toggle edit mode   
- Use Ctrl+N to create a new note   
- Use Ctrl+T to apply a template   
- Use Ctrl+Backspace to go back (previous page)   
- Use Ctrl+O to open the quick switcher

## Templates   
- The default template is located under `Resources/Templates`.   
   
## Edit Obsidian CSS   
![Edit Obsidian CSS**Edit** Obsidian CSS](/not_created.md)   
   
## Embed atomic note   
Most notes should be [Evergreen Notes](../../Private/Education/Evergreen%20Notes.md), meaning they can be refenced by many other subjects and are often short and to the point. If **embedding** a note makes sense, you can use this format:    
   
```md
![[Obsidian#What is Obsidian]]
```   
   
To embed the note, instead of linking to it. Not sure when this will be appropriate though.
