# Densely Linked   
Dense linkage means that every node in a cloud that logically can be connected is connected (via an edge). This concept is used in [note taking](../../Private/Education/Evergreen%20Notes.md), where you put conscious effort into placing a new note into the existing framework by linking through to other, related notes.   
   
The opposite is [Sparsely linked](/not_created.md). Examples of this can be linking-pin systems, where everyone is eventually linked together through a single mediator in a hierarchical system. Thus data can flow from any one person in a team to any other person in any other team by going through the linking-pins, but direct connection is only possible within a team or domain.
