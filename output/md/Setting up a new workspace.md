# Setting up a new workspace   
When setting up a new workspace, there are a couple of recurring tasks, such as installing necessary software, and [Recurring Configuration Task](/not_created.md)s.   
   
This note lists all the steps for a core development server, and for a gui management server.   
   
## Windows GUI server   
- [Installing and configuring VS Code](/not_created.md)   
- [Installing Git](/not_created.md)   
- [Generating new SSH keypair](/not_created.md)   
- [Local Git Configuration](Local%20Git%20Configuration.md)   
   
## Linux core development server   
- [Generating new SSH keypair](/not_created.md)   
- Git is often already installed, and when not, installing git is trivial on Linux. You do need to setup [Local Git Configuration](Local%20Git%20Configuration.md) though.
