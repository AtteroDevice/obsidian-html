# Devfruits/Notes   
   
Welcome to my notes.   
It's mostly personal notes at the moment as I am still working on the code to build this website.   
   
Funny story: this web of notes is built in [Obsidian](Private/Obsidian/Obsidian.md). It is then compiled to html and pushed to my webserver. [Read more about how this site works](Building%20Devfruits.md).
